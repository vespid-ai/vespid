# Governance

## Project Model
Vespid is a maintainer-led open-source project.

## Decision Process
- Architectural changes should include ADR updates under `docs/adr/`.
- Breaking API/DSL changes require explicit migration notes.
- Security and tenancy invariants are non-negotiable.

## Roles
- Maintainers: roadmap, review, release, and security ownership.
- Contributors: propose and deliver changes through PRs.

## Contribution Acceptance
Maintainers evaluate correctness, security, tenant isolation, backward-compatibility impact, and operational risk.
